## About

I am a passionate programming enthusiast, independent developer, and software architect with a strong interest in artificial intelligence. In my spare time, I developed an AI-powered chat application that integrates various mainstream language models, called [AIdea](https://github.com/mylxsw/aidea). This project is open-source and available on GitHub.

I am driven by a desire to explore cutting-edge technologies and apply them effectively in real-world projects. I firmly believe that technological innovation has the power to spark industry transformation and make a profound impact on both industry development and societal progress. My career goal is to become an exceptional software architect, leading teams to create high-quality, efficient software systems that continuously advance the industry.
